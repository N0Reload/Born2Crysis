**EDITOR**

The editor has the following features:
* *Drag and drop obj loader*
* *Drag and drop texture loader*
* *Physics auto generation*
* *Portal creation*
* *One file save format*
* *Skybox*
* *Light manager*
* *Transparency*
* *Sector physics*

The editor can be a bit confusing when dealing with distances and size, and takes some practice.
But with enough assets, one can easily create some playable maps very fast.
It supports custom physics for individual sectors.
